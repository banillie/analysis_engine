The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the series. If the series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".[1] The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882\u201383 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to \"regain those ashes\". The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes.

The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments.

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".[1] The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882\u201383 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to \"regain those ashes\".

He attracted wider praise for his 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85\u201392, released by Belgian label Apollo. He signed to the UK label Warp in 1993, and his music became increasingly well known with the charting albums Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) and ...I Care Because You Do (1995), and singles \"On\" (1993), \"Come to Daddy\" (1997), and \"Windowlicker\" (1999). The latter two singles, accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham, brought James attention in the US market.

The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

He attracted wider praise for his 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85\u201392, released by Belgian label Apollo. He signed to the UK label Warp in 1993, and his music became increasingly well known with the charting albums Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) and ...I Care Because You Do (1995), and singles \"On\" (1993), \"Come to Daddy\" (1997), and \"Windowlicker\" (1999).

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

He attracted wider praise for his 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85\u201392, released by Belgian label Apollo. He signed to the UK label Warp in 1993, and his music became increasingly well known with the charting albums Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) and ...I Care Because You Do (1995), and singles \"On\" (1993), \"Come to Daddy\" (1997), and \"Windowlicker\" (1999). The latter two singles, accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham, brought James attention in the US market.

Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

The increase in the forecast is as a result of cost pressures to the Feltham station sub-project within the Reading 10-car project. A funding solution has been identified an we expect the forecasts to reflect this in the next quarter.  |  | R-DEL costs reflect costs historically reported in the previous South West Rolling Stock BICC report which were included in DfT LTF (current and previous versions) and paid via franchise agreement. The costs for rolling stock are contracted (with all new rolling stock in operation in 2018) and therefore not expected to change significantly.  |  | The cost figures for Non-Gov costs are in 12/13 prices and reflect the Network Rail enhancement forecasts for the Wessex Capacity programme. The projects in scope for these costs include Waterloo; Wessex Traction Power Supply Upgrade and Reading Ascot to London Waterloo train lengthening. The baseline reflects a change controls agreed in April 2016 to cover some validated cost escalation on the programme. As a result the change controlled base line increased by \u00a329m (12/13 prices) in Control Period 5 (2014-2019) and by \u00a320m (12/13 prices) to the Control Period 6 (2019-2024) forecast. Costs for the South London HV grid and CP4 rollover schemes including Route 3 Power sign off Package 7 10 Car South West Suburban Railway Wessex ASDO have been removed from the cost table as these do not immediately relate to programme outputs. The combined value of these schemes (all 12/13 prices) is \u00a320.3m (pre 16/17) \u00a30.5m (17/18) \u00a34m (17/18) \u00a39.1m (18/19) \u00a34.1m (19/20) \u00a39.5m (20/21) \u00a39.2m (21/22) and \u00a38.7 post 21/22. All of these are reported in Network Rail's CP5 Enhancement Delivery Plan. The figures do not include funding for Depots & Stabling (AFC is \u00a344m 12/13) or any contributions from other funding sources including any EU funding renewals expenditure third party funding or from other funding sources. |  | Some of the costs from CP6 Y1 and CP6 Y2 have been moved to CP6 Y3 Y4 and Y5 where \u00a3108.5m has been removed from the CP6 total and is therefore in the negative

He attracted wider praise for his 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85\u201392, released by Belgian label Apollo. He signed to the UK label Warp in 1993, and his music became increasingly well known with the charting albums Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) and ...I Care Because You Do (1995), and singles \"On\" (1993), \"Come to Daddy\" (1997), and \"Windowlicker\" (1999). The latter two singles, accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham, brought James attention in the US market.

The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground.

The projects in scope for these costs include ;  Traction Power Supply Upgrade and Reading Ascot to London  train lengthening. The baseline reflects a change controls agreed in April 2016 to cover some validated cost escalation on the programme. As a result the change controlled base line increased by \u00a329m (12/13 prices) in Control Period 5 (2014-2019) and by \u00a320m (12/13 prices) to the Control Period 6 (2019-2024) forecast. There is a \u00a312m variance (period 11 Jan 17 forecasts) reported against the change controlled baseline which is currently being reviewed and validated. Costs for the South London HV grid and CP4 rollover schemes including Route 3 Power sign off Package 7 10 Car  Suburban Railway  ASDO have been removed from the cost table as these do not immediately relate to programme outputs.
